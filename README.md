# IDS-on-Tree
Here I implemented Iterative Deepening Search Algorithm on a tree for String Construction.
The Structure of tree is as follows:
The root is an empty node and has 26 children which contain alphabets as data.
Every node then contains its own 26 children and so on. The tree goes down and down.
You can make the tree as long as you want by changing its depth limit.

Here string contruction is done. The algorithm search for a string and it search it by finding every letter of string and then concatenate them to show the output.
The algorithm shows the path it took to get the result.
